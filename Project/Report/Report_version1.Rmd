# Introducion

This report describes the results and approaches undertaken by the Free Riders team for a Kaggle competion done in the context of the Advanced Computational Methods and Machine Learning classes at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics, Spain.  

This competition is about predicting the popularity of Mashable.com's news articles. The original target variable, the number of shares, has been transformed into a categorical variable, ranging from 1 (least popular) to 5 (viral). The whole data set is divided into two parts - training (30 000 obsrevations) and testing (9 644 observations). In order to predict popularity classes we utilize will use computational statistics and machine learning. In particular, we implement various algorithms, ranging from a single model type (e.g. Random forest) to multiple combinations of them.  A more detailed discussion regarding these methods can be found in the second part of the report. Before, this we now discuss the way we explored the data.
